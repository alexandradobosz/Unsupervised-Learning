# Unsupervised-Learning: Dimension Reduction and Clustering on Students Performance Dataset
# This project is my first exploration of unsupervised learning techniques, applied to the "Students Performance in Exams" dataset from Kaggle, containing 1000 observations and 8 variables related to students' demographic characteristics and academic achievements. The goal was to reduce dimensionality using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Factor Analysis, and then identify hidden groups among students using clustering techniques.
