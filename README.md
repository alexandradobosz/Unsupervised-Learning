# Unsupervised Learning: Dimension Reduction and Clustering on Students Performance Dataset
This project is my first exploration of unsupervised learning techniques, completed during the first semester of my first year of Data Science and Business Analytics studies at the University of Warsaw. It uses the "Students Performance in Exams" dataset from Kaggle, containing 1000 observations and 8 variables related to students' demographic characteristics and academic achievements. The goal was to reduce dimensionality using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Factor Analysis, and then identify hidden groups among students using clustering techniques.
